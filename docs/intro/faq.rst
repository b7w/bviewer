There are a lot of services, why one more?
------------------------------------------

.. index:: There are a lot of services, why one more?

| Yes. There are flickr, yandex photo, vk.com, google drive and plus.
  Some of them ugly. A lot of them have bad image quality.
  All of them looks like working tool, not cool photo gallery.

| I do not want one more trash photo storage as a part of some service.
  I want service where photo is the key feature.
  Where I can get pluses while watching it.


Are there any comments?
-----------------------

.. index:: Are there any comments?

| No. No like button too. No comments. No any social stuff.
  Because all comments looks like two pattern.
  First "Great!" and second "Bullshit!".
  So do not spend yours and authors time.
  If you want to talk, do it in social networks.


Registration? Privacy?
----------------------

.. index:: Registration? Privacy?

| It is small service and if we ask users to make account they go away.
  Also permission management is hard work.
  So account available only for gallery holders.

| But there are some ways to stay private.
  Set gallery hidden, available only via secret link.
  And set it private, available only for holder.

| Like gallery, images have visibility settings.
  They inherit it from gallery. And there is no way to download it
  if you have not such permission. There aren't directs links.

Management questions

    *It describes how to deal with service*


Where image upload?
-------------------

.. index:: Where image upload?

| Viewer has no upload system. Only image selecting.
  The idea is that your hole image storage mounted from somewhere.
  Today images have big size, and it is too expensive to store it twice.

| At all there is no complex management system. Just files on disk -> nice view, that's all
