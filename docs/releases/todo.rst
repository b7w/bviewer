* | **Any ideas?**
  | You can write me email to bviewer@isudo.ru or use issue tracker
    `bitbucket.org <https://bitbucket.org/B7W/believeviewer/issues?status=new&status=open>`__.
  | But do not wait that I will implement all proposals. I do not want one more CMS monster.

* | **Gallery flow**
  | Up today all thumbnails are catting to square tile.
    It is normal but not the best choice. 3 columns with max fit thumbnails looks very cool.
    To take maximum from that style it is better to mix landscapes and portraits.
    I'm not really understand how to implement this, but I want.

* | **Exif**
  | Sometimes it is necessary to get some exif info. Best ways to show it in right mouse click menu.
    Also there we can display links to download images in different sizes.
