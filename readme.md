About
-----

BelieveViewer is a simple photo gallery written in python with django.
The main idea of this app is personal web photo and video sharing.
There is no any comments, ratings, even registration and other social stuff.
There is no complex management system.

Why this app was developed? I have not found any nice gallery with content management.
All existing software was or too simple, or looks terrible.

BelieveViewer is open source project, released by MIT license.

Look, feel, be happy :-)
